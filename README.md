# strassen_algorithm
My implementation of strassen algorithm. This algorithm is used for multiplying matrices. 
Normally matrix multiplication (multiplying rows by columns) has complexity O(N<sup>3</sup>) but with Strassen algorithm the complexity can drop down to even ~ O(N<sup>2.81</sup>).
It is written in C because it is pretty fast language for computations.
